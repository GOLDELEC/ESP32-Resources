**ESP32** is a tiny soc with 2.4G WiFi and Bluetooth 4.2 in one combo chip.  With a few other compoments, users can use this chip to assamble electronics, like IOT module, camera video stream deliver, wearable devices and so on.

**This Project** collects resources about ESP32, to help users to make a better using of this interesting and powerful chip.
